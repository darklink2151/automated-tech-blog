## The Automated Blogging Strategy That Actually Works

Let me be direct: **most "make money blogging" advice is outdated**. In 2025, with AI and automation tools, the game has completely changed.

I'm documenting my journey building an automated blog from scratch. This is the actual strategy I'm implementing right now.

### Why Automation Changes Everything

**Old way (2015-2023):**
- Write everything manually → 4-8 hours per post
- Publish 1-2 posts per week maximum
- Takes 6-12 months to see income
- Requires constant manual work

**New way (2025):**
- AI writes quality content → 30 minutes per post
- Publish 3-5 posts per week easily
- First income in 2-4 weeks
- Scales with minimal effort

## Content Ideas That Make Money

### High-Value Topics:

1. **Problem-Solution Posts**
   - "How I Fixed [specific problem]"
   - Real experience = authentic = Google ranks it
   - Affiliate opportunities for tools/solutions

2. **Tutorial Content**
   - Step-by-step guides
   - People searching for solutions = ready to buy
   - Easy to add relevant product recommendations

3. **Comparison Posts**
   - "X vs Y: Which is Better?"
   - High commercial intent
   - Amazon Associates goldmine

4. **"Best of" Lists**
   - "10 Best Tools for [task]"
   - Multiple affiliate opportunities
   - Updates yearly = evergreen traffic

5. **Case Studies**
   - "How I Made $X doing Y"
   - People love real numbers
   - Builds trust and authority

### Topics to Avoid (Low Money Potential):

- Opinion pieces without solutions
- News/trending topics (no longevity)
- Ultra-competitive keywords without unique angle
- Content with no clear monetization path

---

## The Automation Workflow

### My Content Creation Process:

```
1. Identify problem I've solved (15 min)
   ↓
2. AI generates outline (5 min)
   ↓
3. AI writes first draft (10 min)
   ↓
4. I edit/personalize (30 min)
   ↓
5. Add affiliate links (10 min)
   ↓
6. SEO optimization (10 min)
   ↓
7. Schedule/publish (5 min)

Total: ~90 minutes per quality post
```

**Compare to traditional:** 4-8 hours per post!

## Real Talk: Common Mistakes

### Don't Do This:

1. **Waiting for "perfect"** - Ship it! You can improve later.
2. **Ignoring SEO** - Without search traffic, you're dead.
3. **Too many niches** - Pick one, dominate it.
4. **No email list** - You're leaving money on the table.
5. **Giving up too soon** - 90 days minimum before judging.

### Do This Instead:

1. **Publish consistently** - 3 posts per week minimum
2. **Focus on search intent** - What are people actually searching for?
3. **Build in public** - Document your journey (like this post!)
4. **Test everything** - Headlines, CTAs, placements
5. **Reinvest earnings** - Better tools = faster growth

## The Math of Blogging Income

### Conservative Scenario:

**Traffic:** 50,000 monthly visitors (achievable in 3-6 months)

**AdSense:**
- CPM: $3 (low estimate)
- 50,000 impressions = $150

**Affiliate Sales:**
- 2% click-through rate = 1,000 clicks
- 3% conversion rate = 30 sales
- Average commission: $20
- Total: $600

**Digital Products:**
- Email list: 1,000 subscribers
- 2% conversion rate = 20 sales
- Product price: $29
- Total: $580

**Monthly Income: $1,330**

### Aggressive Scenario (Same Traffic):

- Higher CPM ($8): $400
- Better affiliates (tech/software): $1,500
- Higher-priced products ($99): $1,980

**Monthly Income: $3,880**

**The difference? Optimization and niche selection.**
